STRUCTURE (x[*] = x bytes) :

8[number of entry points = e]
e {
    ?[entry point name]
    1[null]
    8[instruction address]
    1[number of arguments = argc]
    argc[type]
}
8[number of global variables = g]
g {
    1[type]
    ?type dependant?[]
}
?rest of file?[]



VARIABLES:
1[cttttttt](c=constant,t=type)
?type dependant?[payload]



TYPES:
1 = bool
2 = int

#NOTES
- A const argument to a routine, could simply be a new allocation with the same value, but locked
- the stack should be in bytes, to give me more control
