1. Look at syntax error handling, https://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/manual.html#sec69
2. Allow command_line argument to reference global variables in VM
3. Allow VM to call the compiler, such that "seplin.exe run ./program.sp main" runs correctly, generating a "program.spc"
4. Setup some automated testing
5. Try to optimize the tracing compilation algorithm, also make it more readable.
6. Implement generic type resolution
    - Some thing like: "if (T is int) { ... } "
    - Would strengthen type composition
7. Fix assembly compiler
8. Implement escape characters in string literals
9. Develope syntax highlighting for vscode, https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-textmate/tree/main/test-cases/themes/syntaxes
10. Implement ternary expressions ((bool) ? x : y)
11. Implement routine signature compatability check
12. Implement routine name overloading
13. Fix generic inferencing
    - infer from routine types (the target type (variable being assigned to), must be well-defined in its routine so compatabilit should be simple)
    - Check other places, maybe arrays are broken
    - arrays of structs, i.e "x :tuple[]:= [{1,2}]", does not currently work.
