1. Look at syntax error handling, https://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/manual.html#sec69
2. Allow command_line argument to reference global variables in VM
3. Do some automated testing
4. Try to optimize the tracing compilation algorithm, also make it more readable.
5. Implement generic type resolution
    - Some thing like: "if (T is int) { ... } "
    - Would strengthen type composition
6. Fix assembly compiler
7. Implement escape characters in string literals
8. Develope syntax highlighting for vscode, https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-textmate/tree/main/test-cases/themes/syntaxes
9. Implement ternary expressions ((bool) ? x : y)
10. Add var_mod comparison to routine signature comparison
11. Implement routine name overloading (Requires 11.)
12. Make sure routine types are handled correctly everywhere
13. Fix generic inferencing
    -   infer from horoutines
    -   Check other places, maybe arrays are broken
    - arrays of structs, i.e "x :tuple[]:= [{1,2}]", does not currently work.
