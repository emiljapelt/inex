1. Look at syntax error handling, https://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/manual.html#sec69
2. Setup some testing
3. Remake simple assembly compiler
4. Look into LSP
7. Fix variable modifiers, broken for const array index assignments
8. Reduce instruction set
    - FieldAssign x, could be replaced by: PlaceInt (8*x); IntAdd; RefAssign.
9. Attempt true seplin-to-C transpilation
    - Manually at first
11. More type inference
    - Requires a monadic compiler (i.e. need the var_env to be available and returnable everywhere, manually as argument is tedious)
    - Allow not specifying a type in simple declarations
        - 'x: int;' becomes 'x;'
    - Allow not specifying a type for routine arguments 
        - '(x : int) { x +:= 2; }' becomes '(x) { x +:= 2; }'
    - Introduce a new polymorphic type, 'T_Poly of string', which will represent these missing types
    - Carry a StringMap in 'var_env', in which specification of the polymorphics happen
12. Index References 
    - Should solve the quirk that fields and indices cannot be given as modifiable arguments
    - Requires a new heap object type, increasing the number from 2 (struct/value).
        - Which is a header, and a reference (either to the struct start or directly to the index)
        - The head has the same data as usual, but the 'size' data refers to which index is being referenced
            - This is needed such that freeing an index reference, can find the header of the struct and decrease its 'ref_count'
    - Requires a new instruction, 'Indirect', to create these heaps objects
    - Instructions operating on references will need a rework to handle these
        - Should be something along the lines: "If the object is on the heap, and an indirect, dereference it once more"
        - If 'x' is an index reference, and we write 'y := x', y should point to the same index reference object as 'x'.
13. Move AST optimization to its own compiler step, instead of being part of toProgramRep
14. Cleanup
    - Try using the Option module functions more, instead of pattern-matching on options all the time
