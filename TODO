- Refine error printing for the compiler, especially for references to other contexts
- Allow command_line argument to reference global variables in VM
- Do some automated testing
- Generalize PLACE_* instructions by size
- Implement generic type resolution
    - Some thing like: "if (T is int) { ... } "
    - Would strengthen type composition
- Fix assembly compiler
