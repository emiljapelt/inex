- Look at syntax error handling, https://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/manual.html#sec69
- Allow command_line argument to reference global variables in VM
- Do some automated testing
- Try to optimize the tracing compilation algorithm, also make it more readable.
- Implement generic type resolution
    - Some thing like: "if (T is int) { ... } "
    - Would strengthen type composition
- Fix assembly compiler
- Implement escape characters in string literals
- Implement more generic inference for more cases
    - arrays of structs, i.e "x :tuple[]:= [{1,2}]", does not currently work.
- Implement syntax highlighting for vscode, https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-textmate/tree/main/test-cases/themes/syntaxes
