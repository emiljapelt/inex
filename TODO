- Refactor ProgramRep to represent each instruction, instead of general forms of instructions (Should make working on the compiler easier)
- Implement tail recursive calls
- Only have 1 version of arguments on call
  - current : [s, a1, ..., an, n, _] -> [s, a1, ..., an, n, ret, obp, a1, ..., an, _]
  - desired : [s, a1, ..., an, n, _] -> [s, ret, obp, a1, ..., an, _]
  - might be doable by moveing each of the n arguments 2 places up on the stack, and the placing the return address and old base pointer.
- Implement custom heap allocator and garabage collector (First step towards references)
  - Remember to change how is_on_stack() works, now that we actually know the exact heap range.
