- Refine error printing for the compiler, especially for references to other contexts
- Allow command_line argument to reference global variables in VM
- Do some automated testing
- Generalize PLACE_* instructions by size
- Try to optimize the tracing compilation algorithm, also make it more readable.
- Implement generic type resolution
    - Some thing like: "if (T is int) { ... } "
    - Would strengthen type composition
- Fix assembly compiler
- Implement escape characters in string literals
- Consider implementing more flexible variable modifiers
    - "stable": stable structure/Underlying data cannot be modified, but the variable can still be reassigned.
        - Useful for recursive reading routines, as it allows for getting a handle deeper and deeper in a structure, while still protecting the integrety.
    - "fixed": fixed pointer/The variable cannot be reassigned, but the underlying data can be modified.
        - Not sure how this is useful. So it might not be nessecary.
    - "const": both "stable" and "fixed", only reading is allowed.
