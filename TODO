- Rework the ISA
  - Make sure type related instructions (INT_ADD, BOOL_EQ etc.) all start with their type (DECLARE_INT should be INT_DECLARE for example).
  - Make sure to use follow_trail, for all address related instructions
- Do some testing of the assembly compiler
- A 'Block' should use FREE_VARS to free everything it has declared.
